### July 24th 2020

Created an HTML form that accepts uploads of a text file and an Excel file. Upon change event,
they parse uploaded file, do something about uploaded contents, and show feedback on the web page.

Can I let browser understand edits I make at VS Code? -> Yes.

Now I want to write code that runs upon two uploads are done. How can I fire this event?
