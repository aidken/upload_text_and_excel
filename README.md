# Upload Text and Excel File

A sample HTML and JavaScript that accepts a text file upload and a Excel file upload in one form.

### July 24th 2020

Created an HTML form that accepts uploads of a text file and an Excel file. Upon change event,
they parse uploaded file, do something about uploaded contents, and show feedback on the web page.

Reference I read today:
- [HTML label tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp)
- [How to parse Excel file in Javascript/HTML5](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52870648/1797738)
- [JavaScripture FileReader](https://www.javascripture.com/FileReader)
- [JavaScripture Array](https://www.javascripture.com/Array#forEach)

Can I let browser understand edits I make at VS Code? -> Yes.

Now I want to write code that runs upon two uploads are done. How can I fire this event? Read [Creating and triggering events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events).
